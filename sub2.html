 <h1>Time To Do What I Want</h1>

    <p>Just more time to do the things I want, instead of just school things. It is an incredibly general thing to look foward to, but there's really nothing else I can think of  that I can go deep into. Summer just gives tons of free time that I can invest into different things. I will have more time to sleep in and won;t need to worry about waking up in time for a Zoom call. I do want to try and learn some more coding languages, so it's definitely something I'll spend my time doing. Maybe I'll actually try to learn Japanese too. I could also just try and get into gaming, because despite my friends I don't play any. Anyways who knows if I'm actually going to do any of those things anyway, I've always been  of the "cross the bridge when I get there" mindset.</p>
