  <h2>Generic Highlights</h2>
   <p>There are quite a few things to look foward to during summer. Some things include my birthday, June 15. Some other things to look foward to are the quartantine maybe ending during it or at least making things less restrictive. No more school work is also a pretty good deal for summer too.</p>
