   <p>There are plenty of reasons to look foward to anime during the summer. Currently the only new animes that I am interested in are the God of High School and Uzaki-chan, both of which I already recognized from their original sources. After that there are animes that were split because of the coronavirus like A Certain Scientific Railgun T and The Millionare Detective, both of which are restarting in July. Finally there are the animes getting new seasons. The second season of Re:ZERO and the third of OreGairu were both postponed to July.<br>

   </br> There should be plenty of anime to watch next season. I am actually also looking foward to when the the release dates of the 3rd Fate/Stay Night:Heaven's Feel movie and Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 after being delayed too.</p>
